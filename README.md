Supervisor: Dr. Ravi Kant, PDEU  

## Abstract
This research project analyzed land degradation and sustainable development indicators aligned with SDG 15.3.1 using geospatial analysis in QGIS.  
Focus: Maharashtra State, India.

## Highlights
- Collected & pre-processed geospatial datasets in QGIS
- Conducted land-use/land-cover classification
- Assessed desertification and degradation risk zones
- Derived indicators to evaluate SDG progress
- Generated maps and statistical reports

## Repo Layout
- `data/` — Sample geospatial datasets (clean, non-sensitive)
- `scripts/` — QGIS/processing scripts or Python snippets
- `docs/` — Research paper, project report
- `media/` — Maps and figures

## Notes
- Original full-resolution datasets are large and restricted, but sample workflows and analysis scripts are provided.
